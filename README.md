# Multiple Window 3D Scene using Three.js

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a unique approach to creating and managing a 3D scene using Three.js. It's designed for developers interested in advanced web graphics techniques.

## Features
- 3D scene creation and rendering with Three.js.

## Installation
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to start exploring the 3D scene.

```
git clone https://github.com/bgstaal/multipleWindow3dScene
```
## Usage
The main application logic is contained within `main.js`. The 3D scene is rendered in `index.html`, which serves as the entry point of the application.

## Structure and Components
- `index.html`: Entry point that sets up the HTML structure and includes the Three.js library and the main script.
- `main.js`: Contains the logic for initializing the 3D scene, handling window events, and rendering the scene.
- `three.r124.min.js`: Minified version of the Three.js library used for 3D graphics rendering.

## Detailed Functionality
- `main.js` initializes the 3D scene using Three.js, manages the window's resize events, and updates the scene based on window interactions.
